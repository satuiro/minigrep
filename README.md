# Minigrep

## A Simple Text Search Tool

Minigrep is a command-line search tool written in Rust, designed to find lines in a file that match a given pattern.

## Key Features

- Search for patterns in a file using a case-sensitive or case-insensitive match
- Support for reading files from the file system
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface
- Written in Rust for performance and reliability

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use Minigrep:

- Search for the pattern "nobody" in the file `poem.txt`:

```bash
cargo run -- nobody poem.txt
```

- Search for the pattern "somebody" in the file `poem.txt` using a case-insensitive match:

```bash
cargo run -- --ignore-case somebody poem.txt
```

Note: The `--` separator is used to indicate the end of the command-line options and the start of the search pattern and

## Project Structure Overview

The Minigrep project consists of the following files and directories:

- `Cargo.toml`: The project's Cargo configuration file.
- `Cargo.lock`: The project's Cargo lock file, generated by Cargo.
- `src/lib.rs`: The project's library code, containing the `Config` struct and the `run` function.
- `src/main.rs`: The project's main entry point, containing the `main` function.
- `poem.txt`: A sample text file used for demonstration purposes.
- `.gitignore`: A Git ignore file, specifying files and directories to ignore.

## Dependencies and Requirements

Minigrep depends on the following libraries:

- `std`: The Rust standard library, providing basic functionality such as file I/O and error handling.
- `env`: The Rust environment library, providing access to environment variables and command-line arguments.
- `fs`: The Rust file system library, providing functions for reading and writing files.
- `process`: The Rust process library, providing functions for working with processes and exit codes.
